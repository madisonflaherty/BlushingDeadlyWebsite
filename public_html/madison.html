										<p>Hey there! I'm <b>Madie</b> and I am currently the sole programmer at Blushing Deadly Games!</p>
										<p>I grew up in Eastern Pennsylvania (otherwise known as "somewhere around Philadelphia"). I am also a Computer Science student currently at Rochester Institute of Technology which is pretty rad as far as I can tell. </p>

										<p>As a super quick history lesson, I grew up not really knowing for sure what I was going to do when I "grew up" but decided early on in high school that I'd probably be going for a fine arts major of some sort. But wait? Didn't I say I was the programmer of this team? Well yes, a certain <a href="/jenn.html">someone</a> years ago asked if I wanted to work on a little project with her, and since my artistic style wasn't really needed too badly on the project, I agreed to "try my hand" at the programming aspects of the project - something I honestly knew very little about other than some very simple HTML my dad taught me when I was 11. But of course this wouldn't be a happily ever after unless -of course- I fell in love with it! I immediately got hooked on it, and in one summer managed to turn my future of being an artist into a future of being a software engineer! </p>
										<p>Since that summer all those years ago, <a href="/jenn.html">Jenn</a> and I have been doing projects every summer after school ended to just sharpen our skills and do fun projects together. This summer however, we decided we were done doing little projects and were interested in picking up something a little bigger.</p> 
										<p>That's where <a href="/games.html">Distraint</a> came along! We are dedicated to making this our project for the next few summers until it is completed, and working our hardest to have a working alpha out for general review by the end of this summer! </p>
										<p>Enough of my ramblings now! However, if you for whatever reason are interested in chatting with me, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:madison@blushingdeadly.com">madison@blushingdeadly.com</a> or talk to me on my <a href="https://twitter.com/madieFlaherty">twitter</a>!</p>
