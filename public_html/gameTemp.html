				<p class="blog-content"><b>Distraint</b> is a 2D top-down action exploration game 
					 set in a far off
					 galaxy. Your job is to smuggle and become as powerful and rich as you can - if you can. The alien races that share this galaxy
					 are <i>not</i> supposed to trade - it could completely dismantle each of
					 their delicate economies. But who really cared for rules anyway?
				</p> 
				<h4><b>Features:</b></h4>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Completely sandbox game play, play however you want, where you want. We aren't your mom, if you don't want to do a mission, that's up to you.</li>

					<li>Procedurally generated universe, planets, and cities. Each time you play, you'll be exploring a brand new galaxy.</li>
					<li>Steal and smuggle from whoever you can. But be aware that as you continue to pick from one group of aliens, they'll be paying attention to your strategy, and defend themselves as they see fit.</li>
					<li>Also realize, if you steal from someone (and they know it was you) they won't be too interested in trading with you any time soon </li>
				</ul>
